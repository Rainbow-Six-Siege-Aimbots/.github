## What is a Rainbow Six Siege Aimbot?

An aimbot is a cheat that automatically locks your aim onto enemy targets. In Siege, this means snapping directly to heads or vital hitboxes, giving you instant kills even through intense firefights. Unlike ESP or wallhacks that provide information, the aimbot actively controls your shots, turning even casual players into sharpshooters.
